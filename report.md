Data Science Capstone - IBM Data Science Professional Certificate on Coursera

## Introduction

London is a great city known for its greatness, its magnificent ancient buildings and of course, the English Tea .
The problem is that I'm a tourist who have never been to London , I just know some famous places there like Big Ben , etc. Now I want to know the coffee shops near to me . Thats's the problem we aim to solve .

- **Target Audience - Tourists visit London**

Analyzing the coffee shops in London to find the best of them so our tourist can have a great , enjoyable time drinking the famous english tea.

After Downloading data , it will be cleaned and wrangled to only have the information, necessary for our problem .

## Methodology

The main target here is to help tourist coming to London specifically the center of it to find coffee shops there and don't waste time looking for coffee shops near them .
I collected data for a radius of 1 km from the center of London and divided them to 4 groups

## Results

There are groups that have more coffee shops than others so the tourist may consider the place of his hotel if he loves going to coffee shops.
Also if someone thinking about opening his own coffee shop, he should about building his shop in place which doesn't have many of them in order to grow his business

## Discussion

The thing that only bothers me is the limitation of calls of the FourSquare API , it would be more helpful in finding more coffee shops across London not only it's center if there were more calls available .

## Conclusion

There's no doubt that London's coffee shops are great - specifically at the tea time - with a lot of coffee shops to choose from
Also, we would recommend that our tourist book a hotel close to the place with more coffee shops.
